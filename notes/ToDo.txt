Number Gossip.


I stopped working with OEIS at 127 (I did 127). I am moving down.
I am also moving down with proves. I stopped at 1312.

I will not add the link because this list is highly unstable. It should be self-generated.

Add standard vampire numbers, rename my vampire numbers to disfigured vampire numbers.

star numbers:
Star Numbers:
A 'star number' is a number n, with a property P, such that the number of digits in the
number n, d(n) is also a number with the property P.
For example, 1024 is a square number and d(1024) = 4, also a square number.
Another example, a star prime is a prime number,p, such that d(p) is also a prime number.
54563 is prime, and d(54563)= 5, also a prime number.

sturdy and flimsy numbers


Conjectured properties
5 is believed to be the only odd untouchable number
86 is conjectured to be the largest number n such that 2^86 doesn't contain zeroes.
1331 is the largest cube with at most two different non-zero digits.
?? 88 is the only number known whose square has no isolated digits;
A018848 Strobogrammatic squares: the same upside down (probably finite). Maybe I can prove it.


A suggestion sent by John Baima:
The ability to search for traits and multiple (evil and palindromic).



Add vampire numbers and change current vampire to disfigurate vampires.

From A letter from Maximilian Hasler:

Deficient
Evil
Odd
Prime
Square-free

Of course I knew it is a prime; but "evil" is only property that does
not follow from being prime (>2).
I just thought you might want to mention this
("All primes are square-free and deficient.") in the description of primes.

You might also want to mention the relation between powerful and
square-free numbers.

I don't know to what point you plan to make the descriptions more complete,
or if you prefer to keep them short, so feel free to ignore my idea above.
(and also another idea: to put more links to wikipedia, as you did for
Catalan; most properties have a WP page which gives further info &
links (to mathworld etc))
(You may want to have the links open in a new window, as to keep your
visitors on your site ;-)
