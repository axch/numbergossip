Triangular Cubes.

In my search for unique properties of numbers I decided to intersect two regular properties and see
if something interesting happens. 

I tried to find triangular numbers that are cubes at the same time.
Obviously 1 is such a number - I tried to find numbers bigger than 1. I couldn't. I wrote a program - still
I couldn't find any. I tried to prove that there aren't any - and couldn't find an easy proof.

Then I remembered that just before looking for cube triangular numbers I was looking for cube
pronic numbers. Pronic numbers are twice triangular numbers - they are of the form
n(n+1). As n and n+1 are mutually prime, for a pronic number to be a cube each of n and n+1 should be a cube.
As cubes grow very fast the only two non-negative cubes that differ by 1 are 0 and 1.

This small exercise encouraged me to try to find a proof that 1 is the only positive triangular cube.
I tried for some time then decided to check if this fact is well-known. So I sent an email 
to my friends on the sequence fans list.

Here is an email I received from Max Alekseyev:

Suppose that n(n+1)/2 = m^3. Then (2n+1)^2 - 1 = (2m)^3 or (2n+1)^2 - (2m)^3 = 1. 
According to the Catalan conjecture (proved recently) there is the 
only pair of perfect powers differing in 1, which is 3^2 - 2^3 = 1. 
Therefore, 2n + 1 = 3  and 2m = 2, implying n=m=1. 

A very elegant proof. Interestingly it relies on Catalan's conjecture that was proved in 2002.
Was it possible to prove that 1 is the only triangular cube before 2002? It appears that 
a special case of Catalan's conjecture was known before 2002 - Namely it was known that
8 and 9 are the only consecutive cubic and square numbers (in either order).

I wonder if there is a proof without using Catalan's conjecture. I would be amazing if such a simple
fact that 1 is the only positive triangular cube can't be proven without heavy artillery.

Sequence fans found Max's email so interesting and deserving more attention that someone immediately
put his proof on MathWorld website at:
