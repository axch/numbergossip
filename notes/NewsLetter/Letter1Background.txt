Background:

My mail to seqfans:

I can't find a cube triangular number other than 1. Is there a proof that they do not exist? 
I can easily prove that cube pronic numbers do not exist (pronic numbers are twice triangular numbers).

Suppose that n*(n+1)/2 = m^3. Then 
(2*n+1)^2 - 1 = (2*m)^3 
or 
(2*n+1)^2 - (2*m)^3 = 1 
According to the Catalan conjecture (proved recently) there is the 
only pair of perfect powers differing in 1, which is 3^2 - 2^3 = 1. 
Therefore, 2*n + 1 = 3  and 2*m = 2, implying n=m=1.

See http://www.jaapspies.nl/mathfiles/problem2004-4A.pdf Remark. 

From David Wilson:

Max's use of the Catalan conjecture to show that that 0 and 1 are the only 
triangular cubes was a very elegant overkill. Kudos. 

Later I asked David Wilson if he knows another proof. His answer:

No I don't have such a proof, but my gut feeling is probably that one 
could 
be found, though I would expect it to be rather more complicated than 
the 
Catalan proof.

My comment about elegant overkill is that while using Catalan leads to 
a 
quick and elegant proof, Catalan itself has a very complicated proof 
and 
goes way beyond the needs of the problem at hand.

also known (before Catalan's conjecture) that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive cubic and square numbers (in either order).
