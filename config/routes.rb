  # Sample of regular route:
  # map.connect 'products/:id', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'view'

  # Sample of named route:
  # map.purchase 'products/:id/purchase', :controller => 'catalog', :action => 'purchase'
  # This route can be invoked with purchase_url(:id => product.id)

  # You can have the root of your site routed by hooking up ''

  # instead of a file named 'wsdl'
