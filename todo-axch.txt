Relaunch
- Direct numbergossip.com to new host
- Allow tanya to deploy with Capistrano
- Fire GoDaddy
- Change /status to use svn info rather than unix timestamps?

Database performace?  Do I even need a PropertyOccurrence table at
all?

Get rid of the zero_padding crap by making the appropriate things
composed_of Bignum.


Further Work: Functionality/UI
- Test in IE and Opera/Safari/whatever
- link to the property definition, via the italic name
- links on the number pages
  - random (in footer?), random /w property X
- display all (known) numbers with a given property
  - (see more) link after the first ten (chaining until knowledge runs out?)
  - click on the count of how many there are to see all of them?
- optional longer descriptions?
- distribution graphs?
- Unknown Properties of n, list with excuses

Further Work: Aesthetics
- differentiate external links from internal ones
- commas in the display of large numbers in 1st ten lists?
- make property walking links keep that property open on the next page
  - property-to-number-page links, too

Further Work: Data
- New properties?
  - Refactorable numbers?  Squareful?  Autobiographic?
  - Noncototient?  Strobogrammatic?  Minimal (primes, composites, etc)?
  - Emirp?  Nontotient?  Cyclic number?  Pandigital??  Hoax?  Sphenic?
  - Square intersect triangular? half-quatran numbers/primes?
  - balanced primes? sexy prime pairs? inconsummate numbers? magic constants?
  - supersingluar primes? hyperfactorials? permutable primes? semiprime?
  - Lychrel?? unprimeable? psuedoprime? Smith borthers? pime? autobigraphical?
  - taxi-cab numbers?
  - Do we want to select them by counts of Google hits as measure of
    importance?
- Some more potentially interesting unique properties:
  - 191: &cent needs a terminating semicolon
- Autogenerate unique properties from various families?
- Figure out how to compute (exponential) generatable sequences forever
- Figure out what to do with vampire numbers

Further Work: Performance
- Maybe set_occurrences should make so many db queries?
- Maybe I shouldn't store numbers in the db with so many leading zeros?

Refactorings
- Define a bunch of useful methods on Integers for computing (unique)
  properties (to do with digits): digits, digit_sum, concat, reverse, etc
- Perhaps a "macro" for various aspects of computability, and 
  derivative computations?
- Perhaps a smallest_numbers(bound) method for properties?
- See about the inter-property link implementation.  Perhaps
  it can be accelerated.

tests for existing functionality
- integration test that walks over the whole site
- test coverage reports
- automated builds/tests?
